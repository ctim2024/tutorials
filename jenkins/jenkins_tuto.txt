1- Pipeline Concepts :

  - Pipeline : A user defined block which contains all the stages. It is a key part of declarative pipeline syntax.
  
  pipeline {
  
  }
  
  - Node : A node is a machine that executes an entire workflow. It is a key part of the scripted pipeline syntax.
  
  node {
  
  }
  
2- Create pipeline :

 look at folder create_pipeline_steps 
 
3- Tips : 
 
   Recommanded to not use controller node or the node where jenkins is installed to execute jobs
   It is recommended to create agents and run inside it the jobs
   The agent can be any host or vm that contain jdk installed (for exemple we create agent in windows other in linux ....)
   Agent where we run the job should have all necessary programs to do the work (for exemple : my job execute xx.py a python file , the agent should have the python installed on it)
   When we configure the node we have the input box for Executor : when we put 0 that's mean we discard this node , 1 we can do one job (thread) , 2 two job etc ( we can't exceed the number of core cpu in vm or host)
   Labels are used to identify agents
